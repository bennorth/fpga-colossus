<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
As described well elsewhere, for example in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus_computer">the Wikipedia
article</a>, Colossus was a special-purpose computer, built by Tommy
Flowers at Bletchley Park around 1944, as part of the war-time work to
break the encryption of intercepted German transmissions.  It's a very
important, very early milestone in the history of electronic computing.
</p>

<p>
Colossus counted the number of times some chosen condition was true for
the letters of the intercepted message, usually after combining
the letters with an electronically-synthesised stream of cipher-key
material.  An unusually high or low count was, broadly speaking, an
indication that one piece of the code-breaking process had been
successful.
</p>

<p>
A <a href="http://www.redfrontdoor.org/blog/?p=1241">previous post</a> described in more detail a typical task for
which Colossus was used, and gave a worked example in Python.

<h3 id="sec-1-2"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> FPGAs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
A Field Programmable Gate Array is often described as 'programmable
hardware', in that it is a chip consisting of a large connected array of
small but flexible logic components, which can be configured to perform
the desired task.  The configuration is done in a high-level language
such as VHDL.  FPGAs typically also contain a sprinkling of
special-purpose elements such as clock circuitry, RAM, arithmetic, I/O,
etc.  An FPGA is a 'half-way house' between a general purpose CPU, which
is easy to program but slow at run-time for some tasks, and a fully
custom chip, which can be extremely quick at run-time but whose design
is difficult and time-consuming.  I've been curious about FPGAs for a
while and looking for an excuse to learn the basics about them.

<h3 id="sec-1-3"><span class="section-number-3">1.3</span> Project goal</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
The goal for this project was to implement enough of Colossus on an FPGA
to be able to replicate the 'Chi wheel setting' Python output from
the <a href="http://www.redfrontdoor.org/blog/?p=1241">previous post</a>.  I expected this to be a good-sized project
for learning: achievable but not trivial.

<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Device selection: Raspberry Pi / XuLA</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
There are many low-cost FPGA experimentation boards around; Joel
Williams provides
<a href="https://joelw.id.au/FPGA/CheapFPGADevelopmentBoards">a good survey</a>.
</p>

<p>
For this project, I chose a nice-looking board: XESS's
<a href="http://www.xess.com/shop/product/xula2-lx25/">XuLA2</a> with a
<a href="http://www.xess.com/shop/product/stickit-mb-4_0/">Stickit</a> Raspberry
Pi 'connector' board.  The design and board-specific tools are fully
open, the tools run on GNU/Linux, there is some great
<a href="http://www.xess.com/static/media/appnotes/FpgasNowWhatBook.pdf">introductory
documentation</a>, and the designer was responsive in my pre-sale email
enquiries.
</p>

<p>
The resulting hardware stack (literally), from the bottom board up, is:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a <b>Raspberry Pi</b> (connected to the outside world via Ethernet)
</li>
<li>a <b>Stickit board</b> plugged into the RPi's expansion headers (powered from
the RPi)
</li>
<li>a <b>XuLA2 board</b> plugged into the Stickit board (with USB connection from
development PC for power and configuration)
</li>
</ul>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./labelled-photo.png" alt="labelled-photo.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The black square chip on the top board is the actual FPGA, a Xilinx
Spartan-6 XC6SLX25 device.  This is fairly modest compared to the
top-of-the-range devices, but I hoped it would be big enough for this
project.  The FPGA communicates with the RPi over the RPi's GPIO pins
and some assigned IO pins on the XuLA.

<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Scope</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
The full Colossus had many features which were not central to this
project, so I established what was needed for wheel-setting and declared
that to be the scope of the project:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Bedstead and punched tape (storage for intercepted message or related data).
</li>
<li>Cam wheels (the sample task is to just set Chis,
but the Psi and Mu wheels are implemented too).
</li>
<li>Stepping control ('stepping' is the process of changing to the next
candidate wheel setting).
</li>
<li>Q panel (selector; predicate configuration including 'top' and
'bottom' rows and negates).
</li>
<li>Counters.
</li>
<li>Comparator.
</li>
<li>Printer.
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sec-3-1"><span class="section-number-3">3.1</span> Differences compared to real Colossus</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
The features on the above list will give the core Colossus
functionality, but the design will lack several features of the real
thing.  For example, I have not implemented the 'multiple test' (aka
'remembering') facility; I do not handle 'limitations' or 'spanning';
there is no palette of 'triggers' for the wheel patterns; there is no
patch panel; and no doubt there are other differences.  But this feature
set does implement enough of Colossus to replicate the wheel-setting
task.
</p>

<p>
The input and output components of Colossus necessarily have a different
embodiment in the FPGA:

<div id="outline-container-sec-3-1-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-3-1-1"><span class="section-number-4">3.1.1</span> Bedstead and tape</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-3-1-1">
<p>
In the real Colossus, the intercepted message (or some transformation of
it) was punched onto a loop of paper tape, which was threaded through a
system of pulleys in a large component of the machine referred to as the
'bedstead'.  The tape loop then ran continuously as Colossus did its
work.  The FPGA implementation replaces this with a block RAM.
</p>

<p>
The real Colossus generated the system clock from the sprocket holes on
the every-running paper tape loop.  We have an explicit clock which drives all
components (including the tape).

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
Some details are omitted here; for more, see comments in
<a href="#source-code">the source</a>.
</p>

<p>
I tried to mirror the design of the real Colossus, by implementing the
same functional blocks, described in the
<a href="http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470465891.html">'General
Report on Tunny with Emphasis on Statistical Methods (1945)'</a>, ('<i>GRT</i>'
in the below) connected in what I imagined to be a reasonable fashion:
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./phys-flow.png" alt="phys-flow.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
A pair of candidate settings of Chi(3) and Chi(4) is fed in the top
(<code>set-step-count-cmd</code>), and the simulated <b>Cam Wheels</b> are stepped to
those settings.  The 'tape loop' (stored message) is run through the
<b>Bedstead</b>, and as each letter on the tape is read, the cam wheels move.
We get a stream of 'Z' (tape letter) and 'Chi', and use the <b>Q Selector</b>
to compute 'Q = delta Z + delta Chi'.  The <b>Q Panel</b> tests the predicate
'q(3)+q(4)==0', giving 1 for true and 0 for false, and passes the
resulting summands on to the <b>Counters</b>, which count the number of times
the predicate is satisfied.  Once the full tape has been processed, the
<b>Comparator</b> compares the final counter value to a threshold; if the
count indicates that the setting is 'promising', the Comparator sends
commands over the <code>printer-write-ctrl</code> bus to print a record consisting
of the wheel settings and the 'q(3)+q(4)==0' count.
</p>

<p>
The various components involved in computing one count need to be
carefully synchronised; this is the job of the <b>Movement Controller</b>.
</p>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-sec-4-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-1"><span class="section-number-3">4.1</span> Data-flow control</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<p>
One interesting aspect of the real Colossus was the feature whereby the
counts resulting from one run of the tape are latched in relays for
printing so the next loop of the tape can do useful work [53G(c)].  This
makes sense in the context of the whole machine being clocked from the
tape, and the fact that the tape ran continuously.
</p>

<p>
I was keen to capture some of the essence of this, and perhaps even
extend it: every processing stage should be working whenever it can.
The approach I took was vaguely motivated by a quick read-through of the
book <i>Communicating Sequential Processes</i> <a href="http://www.usingcsp.com/cspbook.pdf">(freely available online)</a>, but
not in any sense formally.
</p>

<p>
Consider the different pieces of state as 'slots' which can hold data.
A worker in some component processes the contents of one slot, placing
the result in another slot.  The collection of workers is controlled by
a set of 'schedulers', which make sure there are no conflicts over which
process is working with which slot.
</p>

<p>
From this perspective, the processing required to start with a work-unit
(a pair of candidate settings of the Chi(3) and Chi(4) wheels) and
produce the corresponding result (printer record consisting of stepping
counts and the number of times that 'q(3)+q(4)==0') is shown below.  In
the diagram,
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Data-slots are green rounded rectangles
</li>
<li>Workers are grey rectangles
</li>
<li>Schedulers are orange rectangles.
</li>
</ul>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./body-pipeline.png" alt="body-pipeline.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The left branch does the bulk of the work: the actual tape run and
counting.  The right branch just copies the settings in case the count
turns out to be promising and we need to print the resulting record.
</p>

<p>
Note that data which are constant over a particular long run (for
example, the tape contents and the starting wheel patterns) do not
feature in the data-flow diagram.
</p>

<p>
This gives us a very different view of the system to the previous
diagram, although most of the same components are represented.  This
view concentrates on the logical flow between data-slots, rather than
the control signals which achieve a particular worker's task.  One logical
worker can trigger activity in more than one physical component (in
particular the 'run tape once' worker).
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-1-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-4-1-1"><span class="section-number-4">4.1.1</span> Slot behaviour</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-1-1">
<p>
The data-flow protocol is as follows.  Each data-slot has a 'producer'
worker and a 'consumer' worker, and has four distinct states.  A slot
can be:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>owned by the producer, which has not yet completely performed its task
(in fact the producer might not even have started work);
</li>
<li>owned by the producer, which has finished its task (the slot therefore
contains the result of the computation);
</li>
<li>in the process of having ownership transferred to the consumer; or
</li>
<li>owned by the consumer, which can mutate the contents of the slot if
required,
</li>
</ul>

<p>
and cycles through these four states in that order.
</p>

<p>
In general, then, one worker is the 'owner' of two slots at once.  For
example, the run-tape-once worker mutates the 'active pattern' slot to
move the cam-wheels as each letter is processed, and also mutates the 'live
counters' slot to count the occurrences of, in our case, 'q(3)+q(4)==0'.
The 'tee'd "stepped patterns with counts" data-slot is 'owned', and so
potentially mutated, by both of its consumers, which seems to be asking
for trouble.  However, it is in fact not mutated by either consumer so
we get away with it.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4-1-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-4-1-2"><span class="section-number-4">4.1.2</span> Scheduler behaviour</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-1-2">
<p>
As noted, the orange 'scheduler'
boxes coordinate the workers which transform data from one slot to
the next.  The behaviour of the simple 'Pipe' scheduler in controlling a
worker is to cycle through the following steps.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Wait for input slot to contain data.
</li>
<li>Take ownership of input slot.
</li>
<li>Wait for output slot to be given to us.
</li>
<li>Instruct our worker to consume input and produce output; wait for worker
to complete.
</li>
<li>Release input slot.
</li>
<li>Notify downstream scheduler that our output (i.e., its input) is
available.
</li>
<li>Wait for downstream scheduler to take ownership of our output slot.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The 'tee' and 'join' schedulers are slightly more complex but follow the
same principals.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-sec-4-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-2"><span class="section-number-3">4.2</span> Feeding work-units and collecting results</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">
<p>
There is also a component whose job is to feed work-units in at the top,
and another one whose job is to collect the 'printer records' from the
bottom.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-sec-4-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-3"><span class="section-number-3">4.3</span> Double-body Colossus</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-3">
<p>
An advantage of FPGAs, for suitable problems, is the ability to do lots
of things in parallel.  A 'long run' is a good candidate for this,
requiring 754 runs through the tape in the case of our Chi(3)/Chi(4)
run, with no communication required between these computations.
</p>

<p>
The design therefore consists of multiple 'body' components, with a
'head' at the top to distribute work units to the bodies, and a 'tail'
at the bottom to collate the results from the bodies.  It turned out
that the design was using c.2/3 of the resources on my XuLA board with
two bodies, so the parallelism was limited, but the principle was shown
to be sound.
</p>

<p>
The overall data-flow, combining a head, two bodies, and a tail, is thus
as follows.  The orange 'body pipeline' box below stands for the above
figure.
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./whole-pipeline.png" alt="whole-pipeline.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
The 'initiate-run' slot is a dummy; a commmand from the RPi (see below)
sets this to 'available' to set the whole run off.
</p>

<p>
The 'iterate/source' scheduler repeatedly asks the 'stepping
generator' worker for the 'next' value, and has a protocol for detecting
when the iteration is done.  The 'distribute' and 'collect/sink'
schedulers choose among a collection (here just two) of
potential consumers or producers, which is done by polling.  These
schedulers have 'indexed' workers, to control which consumer or producer
from the collection is to act.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-sec-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5"><span class="section-number-2">5</span> Configuration and control</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
The next question is how to control all this from the RPi.
</p>

<p>
This aspect of the design is based around an 8-bit address space of
commands, some taking an 8-bit data value.  Different components respond
to different commands.  Each command returns an 8-bit value, and there
is also an extra response bit to signify success or failure, as some
return values are naturally 8-bit.
</p>

<p>
This whole bus (of command/data/control from RPi to FPGA, and
response/control from FPGA to RPi) sprawls everywhere round the design,
which I was uneasy about but it worked.
Every component reads from the 'command' parts of the bus.  The
responses from each component are OR-reduced to give the response read by
the RPi.
</p>

<p>
Some commands are configuration commands, and set various values within
the system.  For example, tape contents, wheel patterns, Q calculation,
predicates on Q, and stepping and print-threshold settings.  Other
commands trigger operations.  For example, the workers are normally
under the control of the schedulers, but each worker can also be
individually triggered from the RPi for testing purposes.
</p>

<p>
The main 'go' command works by forcing the 'initiate-run'
pseudo-data-slot to appear available, and from that moment the
schedulers take over to perform the run.
</p>

<p>
A multiplexor determines which commands are intended for the head or
tail, and which for the bodies.  For configuration commands targetting
the bodies, the same commands are fed to all bodies.  A component checks
that the responses are identical and returns an error code if not.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-5-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-5-1"><span class="section-number-3">5.1</span> Physical interface</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">
<p>
To reduce demand for physical pins, the 'command' and 'data' buses are
multiplexed onto one 8-bit bus, with a separate bit to indicate whether
the RPi is currently presenting a command or data value.  The physical
connection between the RPi and the XuLA board is thus over two 8-bit
'ports' with a few extra control lines.  An alternative (perhaps better
in retrospect) would have been to use some kind of serial port.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-6"><span class="section-number-2">6</span> Testing</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
<i>GRT</i> contains this passage on testing:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The early difficulties were sufficiently severe to prevent more than
three messages from being set in any week in the first three months
of operation.  They arose partly from machine faults (incorrect
tapes from Tunny and incorrect counts on Robinson), partly from
operator's error.  The standard of accuracy needed before there was
any possibility of success was very much higher than would
ordinarily be required of this kind of apparatus, or of operators.
A single letter omitted in a tape destroyed the value of the run and
the ordinary length of a tape was about 3000 letters.  A count
missed at the beginning of a run of Robinson gave wheel settings
bearing no simple relations to the true ones.  In addition there
were numerous opportunities for wrong plugging, switching, and
tape-setting on both machines.  An error which passed undetected
through several stages of the work could take hours or even days to
track down.
</p>

<p>
To remedy this state of affairs a system of checks was gradually
evolved which made it a rare occurrence for a mistake to persist
through several operations.  To achieve this very elaborate checks
were necessary, and about half the operational time was occupied in
carrying them out.  It was made a principal that the design of a new
routine must include all the checks required, and in estimating the
merits of a proposed routine the nature of the checks required had
always to be taken into account.  It is for this reason that checks
are described so fully in the chapters that follow.
</p>

<p>
[p.40, S.15B(b)]
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I find it interesting that the importance of 'design for testability'
&#x2014; <i>It was made a principal that the design of a new routine must
include all the checks required</i> &#x2014; was recognised as computers were
being invented, certainly before 'software engineering' was a
discipline.  I tried to take this to heart, and every component can be
individually unit-tested in an automated fashion.  Often this added a
considerable amount of logic, but the ease of unit testing made it
worthwhile.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-6-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-6-1"><span class="section-number-3">6.1</span> Unit testing in Python</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-1">
<p>
It took some effort to set up, but the approach I took was to build a
framework which allowed the unit testing to be done in Python.  This
effort paid off, and it was productive to be able to write and drive
tests from the flexible and familiar <code>pytest</code> environment.  The
simulated design has a simple 'command line' (REPL) implemented in VHDL,
and then Python code which talks to the REPL over a Unix named pipe
(FIFO).
</p>

<p>
As well as the benefits of the <code>pytest</code> framework, I could capture a
spool of commands sent to the REPL, and replay them to the GUI
logic-analyzer / simulator, to track down bugs.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the real benefit came when the time came to actually synthesise
the design to the real FPGA.  I wrote a small piece of C++ code which
behaved like the simulation REPL, but which truly drove the RPi's GPIO
pins and read the FPGA's response from other GPIO pins.  Then, by making
the Python unit test code talk to this client rather than the
simulation, I could use the self-same unit tests against the real FPGA.
Furthermore, the same system could be used to perform the actual 'long
run' task, and in fact the first 'long run' was done on the actual FPGA
(not in simulation), and it behaved correctly first time.

<p>
We can configure the VHDL Colossus for the Dickens-based 'q(3)+q(4)==0'
run of the <a href="http://www.redfrontdoor.org/blog/?p=1241">previous
post</a>.  To that worked example, we add some code to store the
'intercepted encrypted message' as a Python pickle, so we can use it for
this experiment too.  Preparing for the run involves loading the tape
contents, setting the Q expression, setting the predicate and the
destination counter, and specifying the threshold for printing.  Then
the RPi can trigger the run, and finally dump the 'printer' RAM,
interpreted as records.  The Python code to do this is in the file
<code>tests/sample_long_run.py</code>, which implements a unit test to compare the
FPGA's output to the expected output as calculated in Python.  That
module can also be invoked from the command-line to produce this output:

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-1">
<p>
Various pieces of state in the system have a start-up value determined
by an initialization clause in their VHDL definition.  The alternative
is to have dedicated 'reset' functionality throughout.  From a brief bit
of reading, it seems that in fact the 'reset' approach is recommended:
relying on initialization for signals is sometimes tool- or
part-specific which means it's difficult to port the design to, say,
ASIC technology.  From my direct experience, it made unit testing more
fiddly because the FPGA Colossus carried state from one unit test to the
next, which meant each test had to ensure all state it relied on was set
correctly.

<h3 id="sec-9-2"><span class="section-number-3">9.2</span> Choice of how to compute delta-de-Chi</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-2">
<p>
There is more than one way to set Colossus up to count 'q(3)+q(4)==0' on
delta-de-Chi:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Z, the intercepted encrypted message, can be punched 'as is' onto the
tape.  Likewise, the known Chi patterns can be used 'as is' to
configure the Chi patterns within Colossus.  Then the Q selector is
configured to calculate 'Q = delta-Z + delta-Chi'.  This is the
approach taken in the above work.
</li>
<li>Delta-Z can be pre-computed and punched onto the tape.  What Colossus
thinks of as 'Z' is therefore truly 'delta-Z'.  Likewise, we can
compute the (cyclic) delta of the true known Chi-wheel patterns, and
configure these as the Chi patterns within Colossus.  What Colossus
thinks of as 'Chi' is therefore truly 'delta-Chi', and we configure 'Q
= Z + Chi'.
</li>
<li>Or indeed a mixture of the above.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that existence of any 'delta' operation in the Q-Selector means
that first letter is not counted.  <i>GRT</i> describes a test which should
give a count equal to the tape length; then says 'It is better to count
/s in delta-Z + delta-Chi which checks Colossus delta-ing
simultaneously; <b>this of course reduces the score by 1</b>' [23K(c),
emphasis added].  This is why a <code>q_delta</code> signal is sent from the
Q-Selector to the Movement Controller.

<h3 id="sec-9-3"><span class="section-number-3">9.3</span> Use as decrypting machine</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-3">
<p>
Suppose we have fully broken the key for a message, and so know the Chi,
Psi, and Mu wheels' patterns and settings.  By specifying 'Q = Z + Chi +
Psi', we can recover the plain text of an encrypted message by snooping
the 'Q' bus after each movement.  This is one of the unit tests.  Note
that the real Colossus had no such 'snoop' facility, and Bletchley Park
instead had separate machines for decryption.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-step-both-fast">

<p>
The following observation on 'long runs' occurred to me; I don't know
whether it is new or common knowledge:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
All wheels have pairwise co-prime lengths, and therefore it should be
the case that configuring 'fast' stepping for the two wheels involved in
the 'long run' still explores all the possibilities, but prints the
results in a different order.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The specimen runs given in <i>GRT</i> [section 23D, 'Annotated Exhibits',
starting p.84] make use of the 'multiple testing' facility of the real
Colossus, and so necessarily have one wheel stepping 'fast' and one
'slow'.
</p>

<p>
I added a unit test which configures the FPGA Colossus to perform the
'step both fast' long run, and so confirmed the predicted behaviour.

<h2 id="sec-11"><span class="section-number-2">11</span> Conclusions and future work</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-11">
<p>
While only scratching the surface of the world of FPGA design, I found
that completing this project was a worthwhile experience.  At many
stages, it required a different way of thinking to the software world.
</p>

<p>
I found that the actual logic of Colossus, in terms of computing Q,
testing predicates, and counting how often they were true, was a very
small part of the overall project.  Testability and configuration made
up a large part, as did the data-slot and worker-process scheduling.
</p>

<p>
In terms of workflow, the 'edit, compile, test' cycle was not too bad
for simulation.  However, turning the VHDL into a bitstream ready for
loading into the FPGA was a many-minutes job.  Apparently a real FPGA
project can take hours to 'compile' into hardware in this way.  I
imagine these long feedback loops have a big effect on what counts as an
effective workflow.
</p>

<p>
In some ways, turning an algorithm defined in pseudo-code into a finite
state machine was quite like compiling that algorithm into a set of
'basic blocks' connected in a control flow graph.  Within each 'basic
block', I sometimes used a 'program counter' to achieve sequential
execution within a state.  I do not know whether this is a standard
technique.
</p>

<p>
Given infinite time, there are various directions in which the project
could be extended:

<h3 id="sec-11-1"><span class="section-number-3">11.1</span> Explore alternative parallelisation approaches</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-11-1">
<p>
The duplication of the entire 'body' in this design is not the only way
in which multiple Colossus instances could have been achieved.  For
instance, a single bedstead could have been used, feeding the Z stream
to the multiple bodies.  This would avoid needing one BRAM per body
instance, at the cost of requiring extra synchronisation against the Z
stream.  It would perhaps even return to the original Colossus design of
a continually-running tape.
</p>

<p>
Of course, the real Colossus's 'remembering' circuits achieved a
speed-up by a factor of five.

<h3 id="sec-11-2"><span class="section-number-3">11.2</span> Improve the clock speed</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-11-2">
<p>
The design currently takes the modest 12MHz clock on the XuLA board
directly as the system clock.  I did make a brief attempt at using the
clock multiplier primitives &#x2014; the resulting design seemed to meet
timing, and passed all unit tests in simulation.  However, it didn't
work on the real FPGA.  One thought is that it takes some time for the
multiplied clock to become stable, and my laziness at not implementing
proper 'reset' functionality was coming back to haunt me.  Or perhaps
the higher clock speed required more current than could be drawn over
USB.
